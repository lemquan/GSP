    "# Introduction\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning method where the true labels is not known or sparse with the goal to discover the true groupings. This is a commonly taught technique in machine learning and statistical inference. Many of you may know this is as *k-means* or *nearest neighbours*. A probabilistic approach to clustering requires incorporating prior knowledge to the algorithm, known as mixture models. Mixture models relax the assumptions of a single distribution in the data set. \n",

    "## Bayesian Inference\n",
    "Bayesian inference asserts Bayes' thorem to update the probability of some hypothesis as evidence. Traditional machine learning clustering algorithms such as *k-means* do not expose the underlying data structure, but assumes a stationary distribution. ML attempts to separate the data through some mean such as Euclidean's distance to measure the distance between data points. It assumes that close data points must be similar and share high correlation.\n",

The Gaussian has two parameters that are easy to interpret: mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and variance $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sums of indepdent random variables have an approxiate Gaussian distribution as such a fine choice to model residual errors. Lastly, the mathematical form is elegant and simple to simplify complex distribution arithmetic. \n",

The finite model assumes as a parameter that the number of true clusters $\\boldsymbol{K}$ will be provided as an argument whereas an infinite model discovers the \"true\" number of clusters in a dataset. An infinite mixture model is also called the **Dirichlet Process** mixture model. Mixture models is alternatively called Diriclet Processes because of how we sample from a joint distribution. The joint distribution is composed of other distributions making it a dirichlet distribution. \n",

    "This tutorial has shown an explanation of Bayesian inference on clustering. But, we have not provided contextual details and how we may leverage Bayesian inference at Cisco and in networking. Clustering is a powerful way to drive correlations from similar events. In other words, we are able to identifiy related cascading network events that may cause an abnormal behaviour in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime example of abnormal behaviour is BGP flaps. BGP flaps have many potential causes along with cascading effects to the network as such a prime candidate for clustering. BGP flaps cause may also stem from related events. Performing the mixture model algorithm on a given dataset that contains information SNMP and TCP network statistics, the algorithm indicates three clusters as seen above. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the red cluster, the grouped data shows that memory and CPU utilisation are rather high values. The policing buffer in the control plane notifies a shift in the priorities of the scheduling queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The green/blue cluster groups data with changing route counters. We observe the counter flucautes drastically rather than staying static where some values increase to 50 routes and in the next 3 seconds decrease to 20 routes. We also observe that the link_changed_state boolean is False for the data set in this cluster. We can conclude from these observations that a link flap has occured, and that it is a local change. \n",

    "Finally, the purple cluster groups the data by adjacency nodes too have been decreasing. This indicates that neighbouring nodes have gone down, and is a result of a remote change to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these three clusters, we can conclude that the BGP flaps has been caused by three events. The red cluster being issues in the **control plane**, the green/blue cluster shows issues with the **link flaps**, and the purple cluster is the result of **remote change**. We also establish further correlation in that link flaps drive number of routes as well. The cluster here have some independent events as well as mutual events. Discovering such relationships allows to pursue even more fine grain data. Knowing the relationship of link flaps and routes allows us idenfitiy the actual equipments observing these changes. "
